# Time-Series-Analysis
Analyzing temperature data over time using PySparkSQL on Azure Databricks identifies trends, seasonality, and anomalies. Data cleaning includes timestamp conversion, with monthly averages revealing patterns. Z-scores flag anomalies. Results are visualized using line charts (trends), bar charts (seasonality), and scatter plots (anomalies).
